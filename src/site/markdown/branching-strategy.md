# Branching Strategy

Our goal is to present product artifacts which are stable and usable. Therefore we plan to use a *feature branching strategy* meaning that the technical tasks (as a result of the user stories) are going to be named in our branches. This type is ideal for us because we are going to break down the stories into small, reasonable sets of functionality - and implement them.
